# My Background

My name is Emmanuel Tarantino, I am a student at the University of Central Florida and I am 
majoring in Information Technology.
Although my major is in IT, my future focus will be in the area of security. 

I have been working in the field of IT for over a year now, and the purpose of this portfolio 
is to showcase some of my writing skills in general, as well as a sample penetration report I 
did for a user.

Thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio!
