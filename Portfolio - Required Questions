# Required Questions to Accompany the Portfolio Assignment

1. Did you revise your portfolio based on the feedback you received from Peer Review #3? 
If you did, what did you change?
- I did revise my porfolio based on my classmate's review. My classmate recommended I separate the files into folders.
  It was a very good advise, so I went ahead and created the folders and moved the files into each appropriate one.

2. Did you revise your portfolio based on the feedback you received from the professional
communicator who reviewed your draft? If you did, what did you change?
- The advise I received was to create a website to host my portfolio. It's common for people in general to display
  their portfolios in website, especially if one wishes to show other websites. However, I don't feel I'm quite there yet
  but it is something I will try to do in the future.

3. What was most helpful to you about receiving a review from a professional communicator?
- It is helpful to get the point of view of someone who has seen different types of portfolios and is able to
  point something out I didn't consider. 

4. What do you think is the greatest strength of your portfolio?
- I think the greatest strength may be its diversity. For instance, I have a writing sample from a story 
  I wrote about Plato's Cave, and I also have a technical document in the form of a penetration testing report.
